# Code Reusability:

# You can write functions or classes in a file and reuse them elsewhere without running the scriptâ€™s main logic.
# Testing or Running as Script:
# You can add test cases or example runs in the block, which will only execute when you directly run the file.
# Prevents Unwanted Execution:
# If another file imports this file, the code inside this block won't run, preventing side effects.
